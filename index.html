			<h2>About Me</h2> 
			<p>
			My name is Clarke Frederick, I'm an 18-year-old fashion-loving artist currently studying Computer Science while minoring in Digital Cinema Production and Graphic Design, I'm fascinated and determined to combine the technical side of myself, with my artistic side. Being from a culturally vibrant city known as New Orleans, I've been able to grasp a unique perspective as a result of the variety of diversity the city displays. Photography is my method of capturing a singular moment and movement that encapsulates the feelings and memories of 100 more. All photos under the photographs display are all pictures taken by me directly. My favorite camera is my Canon EOS 70D however I do utilize more than just that camera. Fashion is my way of creating an extension of myself. All of the pictures showcasing my outfits are curated and worn by myself.
